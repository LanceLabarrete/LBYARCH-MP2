### Execution Time
The results showcase the average execution times of kernels written in C versus assembly language, both in release mode and debug mode, across varying input sizes. In release mode, where optimizations are applied, both C and assembly implementations demonstrate significantly lower execution times compared to their debug mode counterparts. This is expected as release mode involves compiler optimizations that result in more efficient code generation. Across all tested input sizes 2^(20), 2^(24), and 2^(27), the assembly implementation consistently outperforms the C implementation in release mode. The difference in execution times between the two languages appears to widen with larger input sizes, indicating that the assembly implementation scales more efficiently.

In debug mode, both C and assembly implementations exhibit higher execution times. However, even in this scenario, the assembly implementation maintains a performance advantage over the C implementation across all tested input sizes. Although the performance gap between the two languages narrows in debug mode compared to release mode, the assembly implementation still demonstrates superior efficiency. These results suggest that while both C and assembly implementations suffer from increased execution times in debug mode, the inherent optimizations and low-level control offered by assembly language continue to provide a performance edge over C, especially evident in scenarios involving computational tasks and larger data sets.

## Analysis Results
### Performance of the Kernels
Both versions accomplish the SAXPY operation accurately. However, the assembly version demonstrates superior performance, especially when dealing with large vectors due to its optimized use of SIMD instructions. In terms of performance, the assembly version of the SAXPY kernel exhibits notable advantages over its C counterpart. By directly leveraging SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions and registers, the assembly code can execute the SAXPY operation in a highly parallelized manner. SIMD instructions allow for simultaneous processing of multiple data elements, effectively exploiting the inherent parallelism present in the operation. This parallelization enables the assembly version to achieve significantly faster execution times compared to the C version, particularly when dealing with large vectors. Additionally, the assembly code benefits from low-level hardware features, enabling precise optimization tailored to the specific characteristics of the target processor architecture.

On the other hand, The C version, while functional, may suffer from performance limitations inherent to scalar processing. While the C version of the kernel provides a more straightforward implementation, it lacks the performance optimization resources. The scalar processing nature of C operations introduces overhead in handling each data element individually, leading to  slower execution times, especially when confronted with large-scale computations. Despite its simplicity, the C version may struggle to match the performance levels achieved by the assembly version due to its reliance on scalar instructions.
